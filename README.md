# `hisaac/ci`

This is my place to experiment with various CI/CD tools and techniques.

(Also see [`hisaac/workbench`](https://github.com/hisaac/workbench) where I'm experimenting with writing a Swift CLI tool for inspecting, configuring, and managing macOS VMs and machines.)

## Current Explorations

My current explorations are around using [Packer](https://packer.io) and [Tart](https://tart.run) to build macOS VM images for use in CI/CD pipelines.

Next I'll be experimenting with using [Ansible](https://ansible.com) to manage the macOS hardware running these VM images.
